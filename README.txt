Open index.html, via chrome preferably, first as that is inteded to be the landing page. All information should be able to be accessed from there using the navigation
	bar at the top, drop down/expandable sections and the reference list/hyperlinks. We have tried to make it as user friendly as possible. For any assisstance email tmartin2@sheffield.ac.uk

Thank you in advance.
